# FizzBuzz
This project will be a practice conditional statements with JAVA. I make a small program that will take an integer input and print Fizz if the number is divisible by 3, Buzz if the number is divisible by 5, FizzBuzz if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, and just the number itself for all other cases.
